# Personal Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website showcasing projects, course notes, and more. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean, minimalist design.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Home page
- `notes.html` - Course notes page
- `css/` - Stylesheet directory
  - `styles.css` - Main stylesheet
- `images/` - Image assets directory

## Features

- Responsive design
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Course notes organization

## Local Development

To run the website locally, you can use any local server. For example:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
